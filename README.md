Hello there!

After completing a seven-month training programm in web development that ended in June, and during which I learnt the basics of the LAMP stack, I am now looking for a work-study in France.

All web technologies look interesting to me, but I prioritize learning TypeScript at the moment. To do so I'm working on diverse exercices on exercism.org.

As I value team work as much as technical skills, I'm also currently working on an routing and vehicule-park manager app (React/NestJS/MySQL) with four other junior developers, that I met through the excellent Modulo-tech network (https://modulo-tech.com/).  

I am looking forward to make my way in the very diverse world of tech.

Cl√©ment.
