Hello there!

I am a former academic in American studies currently looking for an intership in fullstack web development in France.

I began practicing web development full-time for seven months now. You will see the code of some basic apps developed during my recently completed training session in the past months on my GitHub repositories.

All web technologies look interesting to me, but I prioritize learning TypeScript at the moment. I wish I could become specialized in Angular at some point in my career. However, I would never decline to learn any technologies, even if it means I would never professionally code in Angular.

To learn TypeScript and still keep practicing my back-end skills, I am developing a task tracker with Vue using TypeScript, and a back-end in Node.js. (I will push the code as soon as I have something decent to show.)

I am looking forward to improve my skills and to make my way in the very versatile world of tech.

Cl√©ment.
