Hello there!

After completing a seven-month training programm in web development that ended in June, and during which I learnt the basics of the LAMP stack, I am now looking for an intership in France.

All web technologies look interesting to me, but I prioritize learning Symfony and TypeScript at the moment. To improve my skills, I'm currently developing a task-tracker in Symfony 6, and I practice TypeScript on exercism.org.

I am looking forward to make my way in the very diverse world of tech.

Cl√©ment.
